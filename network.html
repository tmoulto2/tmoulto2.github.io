    <!-- Overview of network security -->
    <p>Network security involves protecting data and systems from unauthorized access, disruptions, or misuse. It uses both hardware and software solutions to maintain secure and reliable communication.</p>

    <!-- Threats -->
    <section>
      <h2>Common Network Threats</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software like viruses, ransomware, and worms that can disrupt or damage systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Deceptive attempts to trick users into revealing personal or financial information.</li>
        <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:</strong> Intercepting communication between users and services.</li>
        <li><strong>DDoS Attacks:</strong> Overwhelming network resources with traffic to disrupt service availability.</li>
        <li><strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Hackers gaining access to systems or networks without permission.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Ordered list of network protection techniques -->
    <h2>Common Network Security Measures</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Firewalls</strong><br>
    Firewalls act as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. They monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. By blocking unauthorized access while permitting legitimate communication, firewalls serve as a critical line of defense in network security.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Antivirus</strong><br>
    Antivirus software scans, detects, and removes malicious software (malware) such as viruses, worms, and trojans. It helps prevent malware from infecting endpoints and provides real-time protection against emerging threats.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)</strong><br>
    IDS tools monitor network or system activities for malicious behavior or policy violations. They alert administrators of potential intrusions or unauthorized access attempts, allowing swift response to threats.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</strong><br>
    A VPN encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a secure server, providing anonymity and protecting sensitive data during online communication. Itâ€™s commonly used to secure remote connections and prevent eavesdropping.
  </li>
</ol>

    <h2>Firewall Types</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Packet Filtering Firewall</td>
    <td>Examines packets and blocks them based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, or protocols.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Stateful Inspection Firewall</td>
    <td>Tracks the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of traffic.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Proxy Firewall</td>
    <td>Acts as an intermediary between internal devices and the internet, filtering traffic at the application layer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)</td>
    <td>Combines traditional firewall features with advanced functionalities like intrusion prevention, deep packet inspection, and application awareness.</td>

<!-- Best Practices -->
    <section>
      <h2>Best Practices for Securing Networks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.</li>
        <li>Segment the network to limit internal access and reduce risk.</li>
        <li>Educate users about phishing and social engineering tactics.</li>
        <li>Use endpoint protection tools on all user devices.</li>
        <li>Back up critical data regularly to recover from attacks.</li>
      </ul>
