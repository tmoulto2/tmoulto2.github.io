    <!-- Overview of network security -->
    <section>
      <p>Network security involves protecting data and systems from unauthorized access, disruptions, or misuse. It uses both hardware and software solutions to maintain secure and reliable communication.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Threats -->
    <section>
      <h2>Common Network Threats</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software like viruses, ransomware, and worms that can disrupt or damage systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Deceptive attempts to trick users into revealing personal or financial information.</li>
        <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:</strong> Intercepting communication between users and services.</li>
        <li><strong>DDoS Attacks:</strong> Overwhelming network resources with traffic to disrupt service availability.</li>
        <li><strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Hackers gaining access to systems or networks without permission.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Network Security Measures -->
    <section>
      <h2>Common Network Security Measures</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Firewalls:</strong><br>
          Act as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks. They filter traffic based on security rules to block unauthorized access.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Antivirus:</strong><br>
          Scans and removes malicious software such as viruses and worms. Provides real-time protection and threat detection for endpoints.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</strong><br>
          Monitors systems and network traffic to detect suspicious activity or policy violations, alerting administrators to potential threats.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Private Network (VPN):</strong><br>
          Encrypts user internet traffic and routes it through a secure server, ensuring privacy and safe remote access.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Firewall types -->
    <section>
      <h2>Firewall Types</h2>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Type</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Packet Filtering Firewall</td>
          <td>Examines packets and blocks them based on source/destination IP addresses, ports, or protocols.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Stateful Inspection Firewall</td>
          <td>Tracks active connections and filters packets based on the context and state of the traffic.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Proxy Firewall</td>
          <td>Acts as an intermediary, filtering traffic at the application layer for added protection.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)</td>
          <td>Includes advanced features like deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention, and application-level monitoring.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </section>

    <!-- Best Practices -->
    <section>
      <h2>Best Practices for Securing Networks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.</li>
        <li>Segment networks to isolate traffic and limit access.</li>
        <li>Train users to recognize phishing and social engineering attacks.</li>
        <li>Use endpoint protection across all connected devices.</li>
        <li>Maintain regular backups and disaster recovery plans.</li>
      </ul>
